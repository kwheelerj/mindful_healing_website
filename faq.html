								it hard to cope. We work with people who are motivated to develop a deeper
								understanding of themselves so that they can be more actively engaged in their lives.
								Therapy can provide individuals an opportunity to manage a very specific problem, or it
								can be an ongoing tool to consistently increase self awareness, the establishment of
								goals,
								to remain productive, and to feel more confident in yourself, your relationships and
								your
								choices.

								<p>Therapy can give you support, validation, coping skills, and strategies to change
									your
									perspective and your behaviors. It can give you greater peace of mind and help you
									tolerate difficult feelings and situations. It can give you a “corrective emotional
									experience:” your therapist creates a safe, non-judgmental space for you to express
									yourself authentically and may “get” you in a way that no one else has. When this
									happens, it is extremely powerful and transformative.</p>
								<p>Therapy cannot change other people or external circumstances. Therapists provide
									psychoeducation, feedback, and guidance, but they don’t give advice or answers. If
									you’re new to therapy, or are exploring unprocessed trauma, therapy may make you
									feel a
									bit worse before you feel better.</p>
								<p>I can’t tell you how long it will take for you to feel better. But, generally, the
									more
									you
									put into therapy, the more you’ll get out of it.A</p>

								Most people attend weekly sessions, the same day and time each week. For certain
								clients, more than once a week can be beneficial, but this is something that we would
								discuss together to find what would be most beneficial for you. When first entering into
								therapy, it is essential to meet at least once a week, as this is crucial in generating
								a
								sustainable therapeutic process. Meeting weekly allows us to deepen our work together,
								build trust, and establish a sense of safety, while providing consistency to your
								therapeutic progress which allows for a more productive outcome. As far as amount of
								time, it depends on your particular situation and what you are wanting out of therapy.
								Generally, though, change takes time.

					<hr>
					<h6>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h6>
					<p>
						CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services
						to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person
						or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
						Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
						policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
						companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-
						online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
					</p>
					<h6>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h6>
					<p>
						Users can visit our site anonymously.
						Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,
						on the first significant page after entering our website.

						<li>By calling us</li>
					</ul>
					<hr>

						Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h6>
					<p>
						It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h6>
					<p>
						When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
						years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
						Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
						Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
						children’s privacy and safety online.
						We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>Fair Information Practices</h6>
					<p>
						The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
						and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
						protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
						how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
						personal information.
					</p>
					<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
						action, should a data breach occur
						We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
						to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
						to
						the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
						users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
						and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>CAN SPAM Act</h6>
					<p>
						The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
						for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
						them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
					</p>
					<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
					<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
