						<h4>Why Therapy?</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="section_text text-left text-lg-center">
						Throughout our journey at Mindful Living Counseling &amp; Wellness, we have discovered that
						mindfulness in
						combination with treatment has the ability to connect our body and mind as one. When the
						healing begins, we enable ourselves to awaken a greater understanding of 'the self' within
						our ecological system. By focusing on our awareness, we may be able to calmly and
						intentionally accept and process through thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and bodily
						sensations. By acknowledging and relieving ourselves of shame, guilt, and control we can
						begin to let go of what does not serve us. In this act, we can process though our hurt and
						allow it to create healing in place of tension. At Mindful Living Counseling &amp; Wellness we
						find great honor in
						walking beside you to help you develop strategies for coping and positive change.
