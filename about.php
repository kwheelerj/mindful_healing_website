					<p>During her time at the University of Florida she completed her
						clinicals at the Florida Recovery Center, while coordinating
						research studies at UF’s Clinical and Translational Science
						Institute &amp; Institute on Aging. Throughout the past decade
						Lindsey has worked in many levels of care, from private practice
						to inpatient, which enables her to
						work with individuals struggling with an array of mental health
						concerns.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout her journey she has discovered that mindfulness
						and meditation connect our body and mind as one. This enables
						us to ignite a greater understanding of &#39;the self’ within our
						ecological system. By focusing on our awareness, we may be
						able to calmly and intentionally accept and process through
						thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and bodily sensations. By
						acknowledging and relieving ourselves of shame, guilt, and
						control we can begin to let go of what does not serve us. In this
						act, we can process though our hurt and allow it to create
						healing in place of tension. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In her free time Lindsey enjoys connecting with nature,
						traveling, spending quality time with friends &amp; family, practicing
						self-care, and allowing her artistic and educational interest to
						thrive.
