					Mindful Living Counseling &amp; Wellness brings therapy to the comfort of your home. We have effortlessly taken our
					private practice online with seamless access to private and secure video sessions. No need to
					worry about taking time out of your day to travel miles or navigate through traffic. Online
					therapy at Mindful Living Counseling &amp; Wellness allows for you to connect with a specialist who provides a consistent
					high standard of care parallel to in-office counseling. Tele-therapy is used to address the same
					issues that bring us to counseling; additionally, it is considered a great way to connect
					with a specialist and can alleviate anxiety that prevents us from takingÂ the first step into
					the therapeutic journey. Our therapist provides flexible scheduling times to fit your busy
					schedule, morning, noon, and night. All you need to get started is access to a phone, tablet, or
					computer.
				</p>
				<p class="section_text">
					If you would like to try it out prior to scheduling your initial intake session, we are happy to
					offer
					a complementary 15-minute video or phone session. We are taking on new clients who currently
					reside in Florida, Georgia, and Internationally. To access the convenience of online
					counseling, please reach to determine if online counseling is right for you.
