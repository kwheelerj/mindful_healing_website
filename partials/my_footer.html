					users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en

				<hr>
				<h6>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h6>
				<p>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services
					to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person
					or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
					Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
					policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
					companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-
					online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
				</p>
				<h6>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h6>
				<p>
					Users can visit our site anonymously.
					Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,
					on the first significant page after entering our website.
					Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page
					specified
					above.</p>
				<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can change your personal information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>By emailing us</li>
					<li>By calling us</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h6>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h6>
				<p>
					We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do
					Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h6>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h6>
				<p>
					It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h6>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h6>
				<p>
					When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
					years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
					Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
					Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
					children’s privacy and safety online.
					We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h6>Fair Information Practices</h6>
				<p>
					The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
					and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
					protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
					how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
					personal information.
				</p>
				<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
					action, should a data breach occur
					We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
					to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
					to
					the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
					users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
					and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h6>CAN SPAM Act</h6>
				<p>
					The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
					for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
					them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
				</p>
				<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
				<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
				<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at:
				</p>
				<h6>MindfulLivingCW@gmail.com</h6>
				<p>and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
