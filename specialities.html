								<p>You shouldn’t have to feel ashamed to ask for help too.
									Relationships, communication, feelings of isolation, and anger often challenge us
									throughout our
									journey. These are some of the common issues that men deal with, and sometimes deal
									with
									differently then women. Societal roles and expectations can create a more complex
									emotional
									state, yet less connection to deeper emotions. Often times, men believe that they
									should just put
									their heads down and power through life’s difficulties. How many times have you
									heard the
									phrase, “stop crying and be a man”, or “toughen up”? The truth is, you shouldn’t
									have to feel
									ashamed to ask for help too! In the long run, these emotional barriers will cause us
									to isolate or
									explode externally.</p>
								<p>Traditionally and societally, men are told to be strong and hold it together for
									their family or
									partner, but honestly, we are all human and most definitely can all benefit from a
									helping hand.
									No matter what gender or sexual identity, we all go through life’s challenges, so
									it’s okay to ask
									for help. Neurobiologically all genders, including men, have an area in the brain
									called the
									amygdala, which is the main powerhouse for emotional processing. It’s no question
									that this area
									in the brain is working for men too, therefore, there’s no need to struggle alone.
									Whether you’re
									dealing with work stress or facing a tough decision, if you need someone to talk to
									were here to
									help!</p>
								<p>Our counselors have studied the psychology of societal expectations and masculinities
									for years.
									We bring this study to our work with men on issues and challenges specific to men.
									No matter
									what your struggling with: a life transition, divorce, trauma, loss for a partner or
									friend, anger,
									stress from work or home, etc, we can help you through this challenging time.
									Feel free to reach out to us via phone or email to set up an initial intake
									appointment and get
									started today!</p>
								<p>Here are some ways that therapy can help:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>To learn how to be present in the moment</li>
									<li>To connect better and have meaningful intimate relationships</li>
									<li>To work through anger and aggression</li>
									<li>To improve communication in relationships</li>
									<li>To find solutions to deal with stressors at work and home</li>
									<li>To better emotional connectedness to self &amp; others</li>
									<li>To connect with other men while keeping ‘manhood’</li>
									<li>To learn about power &amp; control</li>
									<li>To participate in self-care</li>
									<li>To find a sense of direction and purpose in life</li>
									<li>To engage in and express sexuality in a helpful way</li>
									<li>To be the best family member and support</li>

								<p>Through experience and knowledge comes great wisdom. Wisdom, although related to
									knowledge, is quite distinct. It is a rare and exceptional attainment that cannot be
									realized merely
									from text. Some believe that it is acquired as time passes, involving insight and
									deeper
									understanding of human existence. Individuals in late life often have a collection
									of stories and
									tales that fill the chapters of their own existence. Therapy is complementary to
									these mature
									experiences and life events. By uniting therapy with wisdom, healing of the past can
									begin to
									take shape.</p>
								<p>Navigating late life transitions can be challenging and quite complex. Holding on to
									the past and
									living in regret can hold us back from our full potential. Therapy unlocks the door
									to the past by
									exploring memories. As an older adult, you truly deserve fully healing from the past
									by letting go
									of regret.</p>
								<p>Words by Aristotle, “Wisdom cannot be misused. To act wisely, is to act well; even as
									to have
									wisdom is to use it.”</p>
								<p>Lindsey offers individual counseling for mature adults who want to continue to live a
									full
									and vibrant life. She can assist in processing grief, purpose, and memories and
									experiences from the past are the threads that create the beautiful tapestry that we
									call
									life. Although the body and brain may develop ailments, the mind and spirit still
									are
									alive! Therapy is a wonderful tool that can help one continue experiencing all that
									life
									has to offer. She will sit beside you as you regain the treasure to live in the
									moment,
									while cherishing the past and arriving at peace with the future.</p>

					<h6>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h6>
					<p>
						When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
						years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
						Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
						Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
						children’s privacy and safety online.
						We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

					<h6>Fair Information Practices</h6>
					<p>
						The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
						and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
						protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
						how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
						personal information.
					</p>
					<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
						action, should a data breach occur
						We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
						to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
						to
						the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
						users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
						and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
