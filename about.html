						Lindsey has developed a strong approach to therapy using
						Mindfulness, Meditation &amp; Guided Imagery, Cognitive
						Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and
						Existential Therapy. She is empathetic in her approach to
						counseling and wellness and is skilled at building rapport with

					</p>
					<p>During her time at UF she completed her
						clinicals at the Florida Recovery Center, while coordinating
						research studies at UF’s Clinical and Translational Science
						Institute &amp; Institute on Aging. Throughout the past decade
						Lindsey has worked in many levels of care, which enables her to
						work with individuals struggling with an array of mental health
						concerns.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout her journey she has discovered that mindfulness
						and meditation connect our body and mind as one. This enables
						us to ignite a greater understanding of &#39;the self’ within our
						ecological system. By focusing on our awareness, we may be
						able to calmly and intentionally accept and process through
						thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and bodily sensations. By
						acknowledging and relieving ourselves of shame, guilt, and
						control we can begin to let go of what does not serve us. In this
						act, we can process though our hurt and allow it to create
						healing in place of tension. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In her free time Lindsey enjoys connecting with nature,
						traveling, spending quality time with friends &amp; family, practicing
						self-care, and allowing her artistic and educational interest to
						thrive.

					<hr>
					<h6>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h6>
					<p>
						CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services
						to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person
						or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
						Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
						policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
						companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-
						online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
					</p>
					<h6>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h6>
					<p>
						Users can visit our site anonymously.
						Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,
						on the first significant page after entering our website.
						Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page
						specified
						above.</p>

						<li>By calling us</li>
					</ul>
					<hr>

					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h6>
					<p>
						It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h6>
					<p>
						When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
						years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
						Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
						Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
						children’s privacy and safety online.
						We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>Fair Information Practices</h6>
					<p>
						The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
						and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
						protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
						how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
						personal information.
					</p>
					<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
						action, should a data breach occur
						We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
						to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
						to
						the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
						users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
						and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h6>CAN SPAM Act</h6>
					<p>
						The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
						for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
						them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
					</p>
					<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
					<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
					<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at:
